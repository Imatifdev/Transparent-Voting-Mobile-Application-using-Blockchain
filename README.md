## Getting Started....
- The app is completely built on `flutter` framework of `dart` and that's why we need `flutter sdk` and much more do your flutter setup by going to the folloewing link
- https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
-  , after the successful of setup installation, clone the repository into your local system using below command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MugheesMb/Pink-Girl.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Pink-Girl

# Open project in VS code
$ code .

# Install dependencies by going to pubspec.yaml
$ flutter pub get

# To run the project
$ flutter run

```

<h3 align="center"> # Well As our app uses Etherium Blockchain for deployment of contracts and use firebase as backend as a service for storing auth data of users. So, to run the project we need to connect firebase within our app So , for that goto firebase website https://firebase.google.com/  and make account and setup your firebase account and connect it with the app. </h3>

<h2>Usage of Infura API in the Project</h2> 

The voting app project leverages the Infura API to interact with the blockchain network and access necessary blockchain functionalities. Infura provides a convenient and reliable way to connect to various blockchain networks without the need for running and maintaining your own blockchain node.

To incorporate the Infura API into the project, follow the steps below:

1. Create an account on the Infura website: [Infura](https://infura.io/).

2. Create a new project and obtain the project ID and project secret. These credentials will be used to authenticate your app with the Infura API.

3. In the project's codebase, locate the configuration file or module responsible for blockchain network connection setup. This could be a file where the Ethereum provider or web3 instance is initialized.

4. Replace the existing connection details or provider URL with the Infura API endpoint specific to the blockchain network you are targeting. The endpoint URL should follow the format: `https://<network>.infura.io/v3/<project-id>`.

5. Update the code to authenticate the API calls using your Infura project secret or API key. This ensures secure and authorized access to the blockchain network.

6. Test the integration by running the app and verifying that the blockchain-related functionalities, such as retrieving voting data or submitting votes, work as expected.

Note: Ensure that you have properly configured your project's dependencies and import statements to include the required libraries or packages for connecting to the Infura API. Refer to the project's documentation or existing codebase for guidance on incorporating external APIs and libraries.

By utilizing the Infura API, the voting app can seamlessly interact with the blockchain network, allowing users to securely cast their votes and access the decentralized voting functionalities provided by the app.

For further information and detailed API documentation, refer to the Infura documentation: [Infura Documentation](https://infura.io/docs).  #### and if you are having any trouble in ruuning this app just email us and we'll help you ASAP..!
